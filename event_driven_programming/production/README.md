# I think I want a README

For this production, I should give a 200-word justification of my selection of widgets and such and such. But before that, let's talk about what I have to do

## The Aim

This production is split into two main sections:

- Create a wireframe for a GUI that supports the following functions:
  - Load the initial data set (the CSV file(s)).
  - Apply the cleaning, transformation, REMOVE and RESHAPE to produce a prepared data set.
  - Load the prepared data set (from its translated format).
  -Manipulate the range of values used to generate OUTPUT STATISTICS, GRAPHS and perform CORRELATION analysis.  
  - Use the prepared data set to generate OUTPUT STATISTICS, GRAPHS and CORRELATION results.
  - A lot of which are a little ahead of where I'm at now, but I can still create a wireframe for each of these views as I best understand it
- To create a first-implementation of the wireframe using `tkinter`.

To this end, I shall be keeping all views of the GUI in the [wireframes](wireframes/) folder, and the production code in a [Week3_production.ipynb](Week3_production.ipynb) file
