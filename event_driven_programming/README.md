## Lesson 1: Event-Driven Programming

Event-Driven Programming is a paradigm that forms the basis of a lot of different applications. It allows a computer to react to different occurrences (events) with custom functionality (callback functions).

The operating system runs based on events, using the CPU clock to time events. In all cases of event driven programming, an event loop is used to listen for events.
