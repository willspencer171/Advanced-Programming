## Why there isn't anything here

I promise I've not been lazy! Much! It's purely the fact that this is not really a topic that requires many notes. It's called professionalism, but this week's content is purely about the ethics and morals that come with the job of developing technologies.

We were given three case studies:

- The 2015 VW emissions scandal
- Driverless cars
- Bias in Algorithms

Which are all separately interesting points of discussion. The first one is a lot less broad than the other two and is easier to find specific information about (i.e. how much it cost the taxpayers or how it affects the health of the public). The other two are topics, really.

Anyway, the main point of this is to address the legal, ethical and moral standpoints of each. Let's go through what this means for the VW scandal:

## The VW Scandal

In 2015, an investigation was opened into Volkswagen, the world's largest supplier of motor vehicles. This regarded a piece of technology called a defeat device. The aim of this device is to recognise when an emmissions test is being conducted and reduce the emissions when this test is being done. For VW, this meant being able to sell diesel vehicles with high emissions (cheaper to manufacture), whilst also being given a clean vehicle tax credit by the US government (extra $$$).

The defeat device was designed in 2007 by Bosch, and given to VW under the impression that it would only be used for testing in a manufacturing setting and that it should not be used to defraud governments. VW ignored this and went ahead anyway. Between the years of 2009 and 2015, VW Jettas and Passats had been roaming the US (and the EU) with $NO_x$ emissions 40 times higher than standardised testing suggested. The tax credit afforded to VW amounted to around $51 million in the US alone. The total cost is expected to be around $450 million worldwide.

High $NO_x$ emissions leads to high levels of tropospheric ozone, which is known to be hazardous to health. VW violated the Clean Air Act in the US and committed fraud using this small defeat device. Naturally the CEO resigned, along with a few other executives from Porsche and Audi.

From a social perspective, this became a matter of personal health. Economically, this cost an awful lot of money. Environmentally, this lead to high levels of pollutants like $NO_x$, carbon monoxide and ozone. Educationally, not so much - maybe teaches us not to defraud governments?

## The Point

Anyway, the main point is to look at things from three perspectives and four contexts:

Perspectives:

- Legal
  - What we are bound by law to do
- Ethical
  - What others expect of us
- Moral
  - What we expect of ourselves

Contexts:

- Social
- Economical
- Environmental
- Educational
